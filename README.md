# Laptop Price Prediction

This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features using machine learning algorithms. The application is built using Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit Cloud. The goal is to provide users with an interactive web application to input laptop specifications and receive a predicted price.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface to input laptop specifications.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts the price based on the given features.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays insights and trends from the dataset.
- **Deployed on Streamlit Cloud**: Accessible from any device with an internet connection.

## Demo

## Data

The dataset contains various features of laptops, such as:

- Brand
- Model
- Processor
- RAM
- Storage
- Screen Size
- GPU
- Operating System
- Weight

The data is preprocessed and cleaned before training the model. The cleaned dataset is saved in `data/laptops.csv`.

## Model

A machine learning model is trained to predict the laptop prices. The model is saved as `laptop_price_model.pkl` and loaded in the Streamlit app to make predictions.

### Model Training

The model is trained using features like brand, processor type, RAM size, etc. The training process includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation

Refer to the `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` for detailed steps.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. To deploy your own version:

1. **Sign up and log in to Streamlit Cloud.**
2. **Create a new app and link your GitHub repository.**
3. **Configure the app settings and deploy.**

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes and commit them:**
   ```sh
   git commit -m 'Add some feature'
   ```
4. **Push to the branch:**
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Create a new Pull Request.**
